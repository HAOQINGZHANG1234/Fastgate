: the

\end_inset

 gate and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 gate.
 They both create spin-dependent force so different entanglement gate could
 accumulate desired phase in the phase space.
 Entanglement between internal state could be realized through the common
 motional quantum bus (phonon modes) coupling to each states in the ion
 trap.
 At the end of the gate, the motional state and internal state will decouple
 meanwhile the desired phase are accumulated.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 gate will create driven spin-dependent AC-stark shifts between the qubit
 energy levels and not create qubit flipping

 One main problem of this scheme is that the finite laser repetition limits
 the gate fidelity and makes the optimization hard to operate.

 paths of different energy level and accumulate the difference phase between
 different paths.

 We find that with increasing the power of pulses (which is also the requirement
 of addressing single ion) and optimizing the parameters, high speed and
 fidelity single qubit flipping and ultrafast two qubit entanglement gate
 in hundreds nanosecond level could be achieved.
 More importantly, with the high sampling rate Arbitrary Function Generator
 (AWG), the wave packet, phase and the sequences time of the pulse could
 be controlled precisely and modulated continuously, which get rid of the
 problem of the repetition rate.
 Along with so many novel pulse sequences design, sub-microsecond level
 entanglement gate could be reached.

(a) scheme of GZC proposal in our realization.
 The pulse sequences are separated into integer groups, with in each group
 momentum transferring in the same direction.
 Here the ultrafast flipping is realized with the fast AWG modulated CW
 laser, which benefits for high controllability of the sequence time and
 phase without the limit of repetition rate.
 The sequence time of each pulse is shift by the operation time of each
 kicks from the ideal optimized condition, for considering actual gate time.
 (b) spin-dependent momentum kick.

 Bi-chromatic lights propagate in opposite direction and shine perpendicularly
 to the ion chain.
 When the first 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

 pulse flips the qubit state, laser intensity and frequency need to be switched
 to keep kicking in the same direction with fixed polarization.

 Qubit states are encoded onto the hyperfine energy levels of

 ion (
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

).
 The ions will absorb a photon to the virtual energy level and emit another
 photon which gives the spin-dependent momentum transfer of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\hbar k$
\end_inset

.
 The bi-chromatic lights have a large single-photons detuning 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 and two-photons detuning 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 Static magnetic field separate the zeeman energy levels and lights with

 Then consider linear polarized light, which could be decomposed into

 The intensity of the bi-chromatic lights are set to satisfy the condition:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{I_{x}}{I_{y}}=\frac{\Delta-\delta_{HF}}{\Delta+\delta_{HF}}\label{eq:3}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
for AC-stark shifts are proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{I}{\Delta}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{I_{x}}{\Delta}+\frac{I_{y}}{\Delta+\delta_{HF}}=\frac{I_{y}}{\Delta}+\frac{I_{x}}{\Delta-\delta_{HF}}$
\end_inset

 to cancel the first order AC-stark shift on the qubit level caused by two
 lights.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 here is the single-phonon detuning.
 The concept of ARP methods are widely used in nuclear resonance and atomic
 physics for robust two energy level system transition.
 For the Raman ARP (the scheme is shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:EightEnergyLevel"

\end_inset

), the whole system can be viewed as an effective two-level system: the
 Rabi frequency is the two-phonon 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{eff}$
\end_inset

 here; the detuning across the resonance is the two-phonon detuning sweeping
 during the inversion of population, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(t)=\delta_{HF}-(w_{y}-w_{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Similar to the teo level condition, the Bloch vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\vec{s}}}$
\end_inset

 will precesses around the effective rotation axis 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Omega(t)|=\sqrt{\Omega_{eff}^{2}(t)+\delta^{2}(t)}$

 We generate the fast ARP pulse with the intensity envelope

\end_inset

 and two-phonon detuning with the form following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

 Here we try to give a feasible scheme with the ARP pulse mentioned above.
 The key is we propose to use the fast AWG modulated CW laser instead of
 pulse laser ,which get rid of the problem of reputation rate.
 So the sequence time and phase control could be more flexible and precise.
 The basic idea is that the operation is faster than the trap frequency
 so the ions get a big momentum transfer without moving.
 If we consider the simple case: we have two ions and both irradiated by
 the bi-chromatic light with the same intensity (same effective Rabi frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{eff}(t)$
\end_inset

 ) and single ion addressing.
 The Hamilton can be written as: 
\begin_inset Formula $H=H_{m}+H_{I}$
\end_inset

, where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
H_{m} & =\hbar\omega_{c}a_{c}^{+}a_{c}+\hbar\omega_{s}a_{s}^{+}a_{s},\nonumber \\
H_{I} & =\hbar\frac{\Omega_{eff}(t)}{2}(\sigma_{1}^{+}e^{2ikx_{1}}+\sigma_{2}^{+}e^{2ikx_{2}}+H.C.)\nonumber \\
 & =\hbar\frac{\Omega_{eff}(t)}{2}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & e^{2ikx_{1}}+e^{2ikx_{2}}\\
e^{-2ikx_{1}}+e^{-2ikx_{2}} & 0
\end{array}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\hbar\frac{\Omega_{eff}(t)}{2}(\sigma_{1x}e^{2ikx_{1}\sigma_{1z}}+\sigma_{2x}e^{2ikx_{2}\sigma_{2z}}),
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{c,s}$
\end_inset

 are the frequencies of Center-Of-Mass mode (COM) and Stretch Mode (SM),
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{c,s}^{+},a_{c,s}$
\end_inset

 is the form and annihilation operation for the corresponding mode, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{ix,z}$
\end_inset

 is the Pauli operation of the ith ion.
 Now we consider the special situation for the scheme: 1.
 
\begin_inset Formula $kx_{1,2}\ll1$
\end_inset

 is not satisfied, which means Lamb-Dicke expansion can not works here;
 2.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\ll\frac{2\pi}{w_{trap}}$
\end_inset

 , which means the single kick operation time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is much faster than than the trap period.
 So when consider the evolution of the system during a single operation,
 we don't need to consider the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 Then if we generate a 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\pi}}$
\end_inset

 ARP pulse: 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\frac{\Omega_{eff}(t)}{2}dt=\pi/2$
\end_inset

, then the Unitary evolution after the operation can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
U & =e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}\int H_{I}(t)dt}\nonumber \\
 & =e^{i\pi/2(\sigma_{1x}e^{2ikx_{1}\sigma_{1z}}+\sigma_{2x}e^{2ikx_{2}\sigma_{2z}})}\nonumber \\
 & =\sigma_{1x}\sigma_{2x}e^{2ikx_{1}\sigma_{1z}}e^{2ikx_{2}\sigma_{2z}},

 Parameters are optimized separately for ideal condition.

.
 Notice that the evolution could be understood as state-dependent momentum
 kick accompanied by the internal state flipping.
 In order to realize the ideal control phase gate, the number of kicks once
 should be even to return the original state.

So under the ideal situation (kicks are all instant without consider the
 repetition rate of the pulses and operation infidelity), the momentum transferr
ing gives the form of:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta p(t)=\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}\delta(t-t_{i})4\hbar n_{i}k
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
where N is the total number of the kick operations,

 ith kick moment and 
\begin_inset Formula $2n_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the number of state flipping during ith kick (notice every flipping
 could give 
\begin_inset Formula $2\hbar k$

 momentum transferring).
 The ions will experience free evolution between two kicks.
 So we want the final Unitary operation has the form of:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U_{F}=e^{i\pi/4\sigma_{1z}\sigma_{2z}}e^{-i\tau(\omega_{c}a_{c}^{+}a_{c}+\omega_{s}a_{s}^{+}a_{s})}.

Then the optimization target can be required as: desired phase accumulated

 Then sequence time

 The plots are in the rotation frame (at the frequency of the corresponding
 mode), so the momentum kicks are straight line while changing direction
 for next kick with free evolution between two kicks.
 The cyan curve is for the ideal condition while the blue curve simulate
 real condition for single flipping duration equalling to 0.5 ns.
 Without the limit of the gate repetition rate, the ideal condition could
 be optimized to reach entanglement ultrahigh gate fidelity.

(a), sequence times could shifted by the finite kick time from optimized
 values to cancel the operation time.
 We could further consider the limits of our scheme in the detail.
 The first one is the limited single flipping time.
 In one way, decreasing the single flipping duration will need the linear

(c).
 The linear kick in the momentum space is not a good approximation when
 kick is slow.
 From another point of view, the AWG sampling rate is limited, which could
 not satisfies for the requirement for too fast modulation.
 The second limit is the single kick or flipping fidelity.
