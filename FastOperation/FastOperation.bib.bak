	abstract = {State preparation protocols ideally require as minimal a circuit depth as possible, in order to be implemented in near-term quantum devices. Motivated by long range interactions (LRI) intrinsic to many experimental platforms (trapped ions, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), we investigate the performance of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with LRIs for the preparation of non-trivial quantum states. We show that this approach leads to extremely efficient state preparation: for example, Greene-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be prepared with O(1) circuit depth, and a quantum critical point of the long range transverse field Ising model (TFIM) can be prepared with {\textgreater} 99\% fidelity on a 100 qubit system with only one iteration of QAOA. Furthermore, we show that QAOA with LRIs is a promising route for exploring generic points in the phase diagram of the long-range TFIM. Our approach thus provides concrete, ultrafast protocols for quantum simulators equipped with long range interactions.},

Here we review the theoretical and experimental aspects of controlling the internal and external states of individual trapped atoms with pulse trains. Two distinct regimes of laser intensity are identiﬁed. When the pulses are sufﬁciently weak that the Rabi frequency X is much smaller than the trap frequency xtrap, sideband transitions can be addressed and atom-atom entanglement can be accomplished in much the same way as with CW lasers. By contrast, if the pulses are very strong X ) xtrap, impulsive spin-dependent kicks can be combined to create entangling gates which are much faster than a trap period. These fast entangling gates should work outside of the Lamb-Dicke regime and be insensitive to thermal atomic motion.},

The treatment allows for a comparison of the performance of gates based on σz ⊗ σz and σφ ⊗ σφ interactions on optical transitions where the bichromatic laser ﬁeld can be realized by an amplitudemodulated laser resonant with the qubit transition. Shaping the amplitude of the bichromatic laser pulse is shown to make the gates more robust against experimental imperfections.},

The optical pulse train is derived from a mode-locked, stabilized optical frequency comb and inherits its frequency stability. Using a single trapped ion, we implement three diﬀerent techniques for measuring the ion-laser coupling strength and characterizing the pulse train emitted by the laser, and show how all requirements can be met for an implementation of a fast phase gate operation.},

Non-adiabatic entangling gates (so-called `fast gates') do not require resolution of specific motional sidebands, but we find that gates designed for micromotion-free environments have significantly reduced fidelity in the presence of micromotion. We show that when fast gates are designed with the RF-induced micromotion in mind, they can in fact out-perform fast gates in the absence of micromotion. This enhancement is present for all trapping parameters and is robust to realistic sources of experimental error. This result paves the way for fast two-qubit entangling gates on scalable 2D architectures, where micromotion is necessarily present on at least one inter-ion axis.},

Gates on neighbouring ions only involve local ions when performed sufficiently fast, and we find that even a fast gate between distant ions with few degrees of freedom restores all the motional modes given more stringent gate speed conditions. We compare pulsed fast gate schemes, defined by a timescale faster than the trap period, and find that our proposed scheme has less stringent requirements on laser repetition rate for achieving arbitrary gate time targets and infidelities well below \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$. By extending gate schemes to ion crystals, we explore the effect of ion number on gate fidelity for coupling neighbouring pairs of ions in large crystals. Inter-ion distance determines the gate time, and a factor of five increase in repetition rate, or correspondingly the laser power, reduces the infidelity by almost two orders of magnitude. We also apply our fast gate scheme to entangle the first and last ions in a crystal. As the number of ions in the crystal increases, significant increases in the laser power are required to provide the short gate times corresponding to fidelity above 0.99.},

	abstract = {Trapped ions are one of the most promising approaches for the realization of a universal quantum computer. Faster quantum logic gates could dramatically improve the performance of trapped-ion quantum computers, and require the development of suitable high repetition rate pulsed lasers. Here we report on a robust frequency upconverted fiber laser based source, able to deliver 2.5 ps ultraviolet (UV) pulses at a stabilized repetition rate of 300.00000 MHz with an average power of 190 mW. The laser wavelength is resonant with the strong transition in Ytterbium (Yb\&\#x0002B;) at 369.53 nm and its repetition rate can be scaled up using high harmonic mode locking. We show that our source can produce arbitrary pulse patterns using a programmable pulse pattern generator and fast modulating components. Finally, simulations demonstrate that our laser is capable of performing resonant, temperature-insensitive, two-qubit quantum logic gates on trapped Yb\&\#x0002B; ions faster than the trap period and with fidelity above 99\&\#x00025;.},

Any one of four possible states of a two-qubit memory is marked, and following a single query of the search space, the marked element is successfully recovered with an average probability of 60(2)\%. This exceeds the performance of any possible classical search algorithm, which can only succeed with a maximum average probability of 50\%.},

	abstract = {Universal logic gates for two quantum bits (qubits) form an essential ingredient of quantum computation. Dynamical gates have been proposed1,2 in the context of trapped ions; however, geometric phase gates (which change only the phase of the physical qubits) offer potential practical advantages because they have higher intrinsic resistance to certain small errors and might enable faster gate implementation. Here we demonstrate a universal geometric π-phase gate between two beryllium ion-qubits, based on coherent displacements induced by an optical dipole force. The displacements depend on the internal atomic states; the motional state of the ions is unimportant provided that they remain in the regime in which the force can be considered constant over the extent of each ion's wave packet. By combining the gate with single-qubit rotations, we have prepared ions in an entangled Bell state with 97\% fidelity—about six times better than in a previous experiment3 demonstrating a universal gate between two ion-qubits. The particular properties of the gate make it attractive for a multiplexed trap architecture4,5 that would enable scaling to large numbers of ion-qubits.},
